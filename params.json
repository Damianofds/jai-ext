{"name":"Jai-ext","tagline":"Oracle JAI Open Source Replacement Wannabe","body":"JAI-EXT\r\n=======\r\n\r\nJAI-EXT is an open-source project which aims to extend the [JAI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Advanced_Imaging) API. JAI is an API which provides a set of high level objects for the image processing. One feature of the JAI API is the ability to process the images in a multithreaded environment; this functionality can be reached by calculating each image tile separately. JAI-EXT improves this API in three different ways:\r\n* adding more features to the existing operations, like the support for nodata\r\n* improving the performances of the existing operations\r\n* developing new operations\r\n\r\nMore informations can be found at the [JAI-EXT Wiki](https://github.com/geosolutions-it/jai-ext/wiki)\r\n\r\n# License\r\nThe JAI-EXT project is licensed with the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).\r\n\r\n# Releases\r\n\r\nCurrent release is [**1.0.1**](http://demo.geo-solutions.it/share/github/jai-ext/releases/1.0.X/1.0.1/). More informations about the releases can be found [here](https://github.com/geosolutions-it/jai-ext/wiki/Releases).\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\nHere the user can find a guide for executing a JAI-EXT operation and a brief description of the most important parameters to use:\r\n* [Fifteen minutes guide](https://github.com/geosolutions-it/jai-ext/wiki/Fifteen-minutes-Guide)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Getting Support\r\n## Mailing List\r\nWe have created two public mailing lists for JAI-Ext one for Developers and one for Users, you can find their homepages here below:\r\n\r\n* [**JAI-Ext Users Group**](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jai-ext-users)\r\n* [**JAI-Ext Developers Group**](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jai-ext-developers)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Professional Support\r\nJAI-Ext has been developed by [**GeoSolutions**](http://www.geo-solutions.it) as an internal effort to replace Oracle JAI operations which are basically unsupported at the time of writing. \r\n\r\nWe welcome contributions in any form:\r\n\r\n* pull requests for new features\r\n* pull requests for bug fixes\r\n* pull requests for documentation\r\n* funding for any combination of the above\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
