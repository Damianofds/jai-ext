JAI-EXT
=======

JAI-EXT is an open-source project which aims to extend the [JAI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Advanced_Imaging) API. JAI is an API which provides a set of high level objects for the image processing. One feature of the JAI API is the ability to process the images in a multithreaded environment; this functionality can be reached by calculating each image tile separately. JAI-EXT improves this API in three different ways:
* adding more features to the existing operations, like the support for nodata;
* improving the performances of the existing operations; 
* developing new operations.
